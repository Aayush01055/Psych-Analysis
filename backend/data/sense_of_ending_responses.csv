Searching for meaning in his past,Freaked out that I might be losing the real stuff,Panicked there’s not enough time to do it all,Fired up to shake things up now,Pushes me to build better moments today,Nervous about how my life stacks up online,Stressed I’m not keeping up with life,A kick to rethink how I roll
"Kinda detached, just observing his own memories",Not sure what’s legit anymore,"Kinda zoned out, like time’s whatever",Anxious I’m running out of chances,Too much to process how different life is now,Nervous about how my life stacks up online,Ready to own my path,Life’s short and kinda unsettling
"Kinda detached, just observing his own memories",Freaked out that I might be losing the real stuff,"Like time’s this big, meaningless blur",Feels like a chill acceptance of life’s flow,Same—my past isn’t who I am,Creeped out by how fast time slips away,Stressed I’m not keeping up with life,Not sure what to focus on anymore
Searching for meaning in his past,Worried how my past looks to others,Pumped to make every second count,Feels like a chill acceptance of life’s flow,Same—my past isn’t who I am,Inspired to live with more purpose,Ready to own my path,A kick to rethink how I roll
Stressed about what he’s missed out on in life,Freaked out that I might be losing the real stuff,"Kinda zoned out, like time’s whatever",Anxious I’m running out of chances,Pushes me to build better moments today,Inspired to live with more purpose,Overloaded by all the expectations,Not sure what to focus on anymore

Bogged down by the heaviness of it all,Freaked out that I might be losing the real stuff,"Kinda zoned out, like time’s whatever",Fired up to shake things up now,Makes me stress about not treasuring it enough,Inspired to live with more purpose,Like a nudge to fix what’s broken,Life’s short and kinda unsettling
Bogged down by the heaviness of it all,Like my past is just a remix I made up,Pumped to make every second count,Fired up to shake things up now,Makes me stress about not treasuring it enough,Mixed up about what’s worth caring about,Ready to own my path,Life’s short and kinda unsettling
